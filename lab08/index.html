        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is <strong>Kendall Hymes</strong> I am a sophomore studying <strong>Public Relations</strong> at Syracuse University, with a minor in <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong>. Within the field of strategic communication, I am interested in social media and digital branding. I am also fascinated by how social media and technology intersect, and I love finding new ways that communications professionals can take advantage of emerging technologies. I offer strong skills in research, design and writing; being well-versed in AP style and the adobe creative suite.
            I am very involved in extracurricular activities. This past year, I have served as the graphic design chair for <strong>SU Danceworks</strong>, where I have been responsible for designing digital content and writing newsletters for the organization. I have also been involved in <strong>Hill Communications</strong>, SU's only student-run public relations firm. </p>
        <div class="clear"></div> <p>I would describe myself as an explorer. Whether trying foods, making playlists or traveling, I love discovering new things. My enthusiasm for the unknown gives me the drive to seek innovation in all aspects of my life.</p>
