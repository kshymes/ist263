        Hello! My name is Kendall Hymes I am a sophomore studying Public Relations at Syracuse University, with a minor in Information Management and Technology. Within the field of strategic communication, I am interested in social media and digital branding. I am also fascinated by how social media and technology intersect, and I love finding new ways that communications professionals can take advantage of emerging technologies. I offer strong skills in research, design and writing; being well-versed in AP style and the adobe creative suite.
 I am very involved in extracurricular activities. This past year, I have served as the graphic design chair for SU Danceworks, where I have been responsible for designing digital content and writing newsletters for the organization. I have also been involved in Hill Communications, SUâ€™s only student-run public relations firm.
 I would describe myself as an explorer. Whether trying foods, making playlists or traveling, I love discovering new things. My enthusiasm for the unknown gives me the drive to seek innovation in all aspects of my life.
