            Perhaps one of the most rewarding opportunities I’ve had thus far was the chance to serve on the Danceworks executive board. Serving as co-producer for the 2023-2024 year and co-director of the 2024-2025 year, I have been in charge of all creative and logistical aspects of the organization and overseeing 15 board members in executing their designated tasks. Additionally, I have been responsible for overseeing the entire production for our spring show. Seeing all the dances come together and our visions coming to life has been a dream come true.

            My experience with the Burnham Park Association showed me how website design, branding and public relations all come together. During fall of 2023, I led a group of five associates in rebranding BPA including a new logo, brand guide and website. This project was a great combination of my technological and creative skills.

            My role as graphic design chair for SU Danceworks has given me the invaluable opportunity to further my professional experience in strategic communications for an organization that I am passionate about. During the 2022-2023 school year, I was responsible for establishing and maintaining online brand guidelines, writing monthly newsletters, and designing all social media content and promotional materials for events and performances. Additionally, I worked with the public relations chairs to create videos and coordinate photoshoots in the promotion of our showcase in March 2023.

            I began working as a research assistant through Syracuse’s SOURCE program in January 2023. Working under Dr. Erika Schneider, Regina Lutrell, and alongside undergraduate peers. Throughout the spring 2023 semester, I researched organizations’ efforts to become more sustainable, and their public’s attitudes toward sustainable consumption. Recently, the team has been utilizing new artificial intelligence tools to determine how it could potentially benefit the research process.

            In the spring of 2023, I was promoted to an account supervisor for Hill Communications, Syracuse University’s student-run PR firm. Hatfield & Schwartz is a law firm based in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey; and it specializes in employment law.  H&S was a new client with the firm, and it was very rewarding to build this new relationship with our firm.

            In the Fall of 2022, I had the bragging rights of saying that I did the public relations for the Newhouse publications department. This was a great opportunity for me to build connections within my department of study. Throughout the semester I conducted competitive research on the social media presence of competing public relations programs, and made suggestions for things that we could adopt to the Newhouse PR social media accounts. I also helped create and maintain a social media content calendar for the social media accounts. As an account executive, I was responsible for keeping minutes during our meetings and preparing the budget.
