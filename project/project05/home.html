   <h2> 
    Hi, I'm Kendall!
   </h2> 
   <p>
    I am a sophomore studying Public Relations at Syracuse University, with a minor in Information Management and Technology. Within the field of strategic communication, I am interested in social media and digital branding. I am also fascinated by how social media and technology intersect, and I love finding new ways that communications professionals can take advantage of emerging technologies. I offer strong skills in research, design and writing; being well-versed in AP style and the adobe creative suite.

    I am very involved in extracurricular activities. This past year, I have served as the graphic design chair for SU Danceworks, where I have been responsible for designing digital content and writing newsletters for the organization. Next year, I will take on the producer role, where I will assist the directors in overseeing all creative and logistic aspects of the organization. I have also been involved in Hill Communications, SU&#39;s only student-run public relations firm. These past three semesters, I have been able to work with clients in a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to education. This website showcases the work I have done inside and outside the classroom. </p>
